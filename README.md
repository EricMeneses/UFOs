# UFOs
Module 11

## Overview of Project
In working with Dana, she wanted to create an interactive dashboard that would be impressive to NASA. First thing she wanted to create was a filterable table to display data around UFO sightings. We were able to complete this task by working with variables and lists. Next, we began to build a page using JavaScript. With JavaScript, we juggled a few files at once; HTML, JavaScript, images and a CSS Style sheet. We then utilized for loops to iterate through the data so that it could be added to the table we created. We then took advantage of Data-Driven Documents (D3) to make our table interactive. We did so by utilizing filters to access specific features in her data by using several different key terms, such as date or location. Once we finished, we decided to add color and an image on the webpage to make it more visually apealing.
